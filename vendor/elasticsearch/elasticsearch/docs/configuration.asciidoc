== Configuration

Almost every aspect of the client is configurable.  Most users will only need to configure a few parameters to suit
their needs, but it is possible to completely replace much of the internals if required.

Custom configuration is accomplished before the client is instantiated, through the ClientBuilder helper object.
We'll walk through all the configuration options and show sample code to replace the various components.

=== Host Configuration

The most common configuration is telling the client about your cluster: how many nodes, their addresses and ports.  If
not hosts are specified, the client will attempt to connect to `localhost:9200`.

This behavior can be changed by using the `setHosts()` method on `ClientBuilder`.  The method accepts an array of values,
each entry corresponding to one node in your cluster.  The format of the host can vary, depending on your needs (ip vs
hostname, port, ssl, etc)

[source,php]
----
$hosts = [
    '192.168.1.1:9200',         // IP + Port
    '192.168.1.2',              // Just IP
    'mydomain.server.com:9201', // Domain + Port
    'mydomain2.server.com',     // Just Domain
    'https://localhost',        // SSL to localhost
    'https://192.168.1.3:9200'  // SSL to IP + Port
];
$client = ClientBuilder::create()           // Instantiate a new ClientBuilder
                    ->setHosts($hosts)      // Set the hosts
                    ->build();              // Build the client object
----

Notice that the `ClientBuilder` object allows chaining method calls for brevity.  It is also possible to call the methods
individually:

[source,php]
----
$hosts = [
    '192.168.1.1:9200',         // IP + Port
    '192.168.1.2',              // Just IP
    'mydomain.server.com:9201', // Domain + Port
    'mydomain2.server.com',     // Just Domain
    'https://localhost',        // SSL to localhost
    'https://192.168.1.3:9200'  // SSL to IP + Port
];
$clientBuilder = ClientBuilder::create();   // Instantiate a new ClientBuilder
$clientBuilder->setHosts($hosts);           // Set the hosts
$client = $clientBuilder->build();          // Build the client object
----

=== Authorization and Encryption

For details about HTTP Authorization and SSL encryption, please see link:_security.html[Authorization and SSL].

=== Set retries

By default, the client will retry `n` times, where `n = number of nodes` in your cluster.  A retry is only performed
if the operation results in a "hard" exception: connection refusal, connection timeout, DNS lookup timeout, etc.  4xx and
5xx errors are not considered retry'able events, since the node returns an operational response.

If you would like to disable retries, or change the number, you can do so with the `setRetries()` method:

[source,php]
----------------------------

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
                    ->setRetries(2)
                    ->build();
----------------------------

When the client runs out of retries, it will throw the last exception that it received.  For example, if you have ten
alive nodes, and `setRetries(5)`, the client will attempt to execute the command up to five times.  If all five nodes
result in a connection timeout (for example), the client will throw an `OperationTimeoutException`.  Depending on the
Connection Pool being used, these nodes may also be marked dead.

To help in identification, exceptions that are thrown due to max retries will wrap a `MaxRetriesException`.  For example,
you can catch a specific curl exception then check if it wraps a MaxRetriesException using `getPrevious()`:

[source,php]
----
$client = Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder::create()
    ->setHosts(["localhost:1"])
    ->setRetries(0)
    ->build();

try {
    $client->search($searchParams);
} catch (Elasticsearch\Common\Exceptions\Curl\CouldNotConnectToHost $e) {
    $previous = $e->getPrevious();
    if ($previous instanceof 'Elasticsearch\Common\Exceptions\MaxRetriesException') {
        echo "Max retries!"
    }
}
----------------------------

Alternatively, all "hard" curl exceptions (`CouldNotConnectToHost`, `CouldNotResolveHostException`, `OperationTimeoutException`)
extend the more general `TransportException`.  So you could instead catch the general `TransportException` and then
check it's previous value:

[source,php]
----
$client = Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder::create()
    ->setHosts(["localhost:1"])
    ->setRetries(0)
    ->build();

try {
    $client->search($searchParams);
} catch (Elasticsearch\Common\Exceptions\TransportException $e) {
    $previous = $e->getPrevious();
    if ($previous instanceof 'Elasticsearch\Common\Exceptions\MaxRetriesException') {
        echo "Max retries!"
    }
}
----------------------------


[[enabling_logger]]
=== Enabling the Logger
Elasticsearch-PHP supports logging, but it is not enabled by default for performance reasons.  If you wish to enable logging,
you need to select a logging implementation, install it, then enable the logger in the Client.  The recommended logger
is https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog[Monolog], but any logger that implements the `PSR/Log` interface will work.

You might have noticed that Monolog was suggested during installation.  To begin using Monolog, add it to your `composer.json`:

[source,json]
----------------------------
{
    "require": {
        ...
        "elasticsearch/elasticsearch" : "~2.0",
        "monolog/monolog": "~1.0"
    }
}
----------------------------

And then update your composer installation:

[source,shell]
----------------------------
php composer.phar update
----------------------------

Once Monolog (or another logger) is installed, you need to create a log object and inject it into the client.  The
`ClientBuilder` object has a helper static function that will generate a common Monolog-based logger for you.  All you need
to do is provide the path to your desired logging location:

[source,php]
----
$logger = ClientBuilder::defaultLogger('path/to/your.log');

$client = ClientBuilder::create()       // Instantiate a new ClientBuilder
            ->setLogger($logger)        // Set the logger with a default logger
            ->build();                  // Build the client object
----

You can also specify the severity of log messages that you wish to log:

[source,php]
----
// set severity with second parameter
$logger = ClientBuilder::defaultLogger('/path/to/logs/', Logger::INFO);

$client = ClientBuilder::create()       // Instantiate a new ClientBuilder
            ->setLogger($logger)        // Set the logger with a default logger
            ->build();                  // Build the client object
----

The `defaultLogger()` method is just a helper, you are not required to use it.  You can create your own logger and inject
that instead:


[source,php]
----
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

$logger = new Logger('name');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('path/to/your.log', Logger::WARNING));

$client = ClientBuilder::create()       // Instantiate a new ClientBuilder
            ->setLogger($logger)        // Set your custom logger
            ->build();                  // Build the client object
----


=== Configure the HTTP Handler

Elasticsearch-PHP uses an interchangeable HTTP transport layer called https://github.com/guzzle/RingPHP/[RingPHP].  This
allows the client to construct a generic HTTP request, then pass it to the transport layer to execute.  The actual execution
details are hidden from the client and modular, so that you can choose from several HTTP handlers depending on your needs.

The default handler that the client uses is a combination handler.  When executing in synchronous mode, the handler
uses `CurlHandler`, which executes single curl calls.  These are very fast for single requests.  When asynchronous (future)
mode is enabled, the handler switches to `CurlMultiHandler`, which uses the curl_multi interface.  This involves a bit
more overhead, but allows batches of HTTP requests to be processed in parallel.

You can configure the HTTP handler with one of several helper functions, or provide your own custom handler:

[source,php]
----
$defaultHandler = ClientBuilder::defaultHandler();
$singleHandler  = ClientBuilder::singleHandler();
$multiHandler   = ClientBuilder::multiHandler();
$customHandler  = new MyCustomHandler();

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->setHandler($defaultHandler)
            ->build();
----

For details on creating your own custom Ring handler, please see the http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/handlers.html[RingPHP Documentation]

The default handler is recommended in almost all cases.  This allows fast synchronous execution, while retaining flexibility
to invoke parallel batches with async future mode.  You may consider using just the `singleHandler` if you know you will
never need async capabilities, since it will save a small amount of overhead by reducing indirection.


=== Setting the Connection Pool

The client maintains a pool of connections, with each connection representing a node in your cluster.  There are several
connection pool implementations available, and each has slightly different behavior (pinging vs no pinging, etc).
Connection pools are configured via the `setConnectionPool()` method:

[source,php]
----
$connectionPool = '\Elasticsearch\ConnectionPool\StaticNoPingConnectionPool';
$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->setConnectionPool($connectionPool)
            ->build();
----

For more details, please see the dedicated page on link:_connection_pool.html[configuring connection pools].

=== Setting the Connection Selector

The connection pool manages the connections to your cluster, but the Selector is the logic that decides which connection
should be used for the next API request.  There are several selectors that you can choose from.  Selectors can be changed
via the `setSelector()` method:

[source,php]
----
$selector = '\Elasticsearch\ConnectionPool\Selectors\StickyRoundRobinSelector';
$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->setSelector($selector)
            ->build();
----

For more details, please see the dedicated page on link:_selectors.html[configuring selectors].


=== Setting the Serializer

Requests are given to the client in the form of associative arrays, but Elasticsearch expects JSON.  The Serializer's
job is to serialize PHP objects into JSON.  It also de-serializes JSON back into PHP arrays.  This seems trivial, but
there are a few edgecases which make it useful for the serializer to remain modular.

The majority of people will never need to change the default serializer (`SmartSerializer`), but if you need to,
it can be done via the `setSerializer()` method:

[source,php]
----
$serializer = '\Elasticsearch\Serializers\SmartSerializer';
$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->setSerializer($serializer)
            ->build();
----

For more details, please see the dedicated page on link:_serializers.html[configuring serializers].


=== Setting a custom ConnectionFactory

The ConnectionFactory instantiates new Connection objects when requested by the ConnectionPool.  A single Connection
represents a single node.  Since the client hands actual networking work over to RingPHP, the Connection's main job is
book-keeping:  Is this node alive?  Did it fail a ping request?  What is the host and port?

There is little reason to provide your own ConnectionFactory, but if you need to do so, you need to supply an intact
ConnectionFactory object to the `setConnectionFactory()` method.  The object should implement the `ConnectionFactoryInterface`
interface.

[source,php]
----

class MyConnectionFactory implements ConnectionFactoryInterface
{

    public function __construct($handler, array $connectionParams,
                                SerializerInterface $serializer,
                                LoggerInterface $logger,
                                LoggerInterface $tracer)
    {
       // Code here
    }


    /**
     * @param $hostDetails
     *
     * @return ConnectionInterface
     */
    public function create($hostDetails)
    {
        // Code here...must return a Connection object
    }
}


$connectionFactory = new MyConnectionFactory(
    $handler,
    $connectionParams,
    $serializer,
    $logger,
    $tracer
);

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->setConnectionFactory($connectionFactory);
            ->build();
----

As you can see, if you decide to inject your own ConnectionFactory, you take over the responsibiltiy of wiring it correctly.
The ConnectionFactory requires a working HTTP handler, serializer, logger and tracer.


=== Set the Endpoint closure

The client uses an Endpoint closure to dispatch API requests to the correct Endpoint object.  A namespace object will
construct a new Endpoint via this closure, which means this is a handy location if you wish to extend the available set
of API endpoints available

For example, we could add a new endpoint like so:

[source,php]
----

$transport = $this->transport;
$serializer = $this->serializer;

$newEndpoint = function ($class) use ($transport, $serializer) {
    if ($class == 'SuperSearch') {
        return new MyProject\SuperSearch($transport);
    } else {
        // Default handler
        $fullPath = '\\Elasticsearch\\Endpoints\\' . $class;
        if ($class === 'Bulk' || $class === 'Msearch' || $class === 'MPercolate') {
            return new $fullPath($transport, $serializer);
        } else {
            return new $fullPath($transport);
        }
    }
};

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->setEndpoint($newEndpoint)
            ->build();
----

Obviously, by doing this you take responsibility that all existing endpoints still function correctly.  And you also
assume the responsibility of correctly wiring the Transport and Serializer into each endpoint.


=== Building the client from a configuration hash

To help ease automated building of the client, all configurations can be provided in a setting
hash instead of calling the individual methods directly.  This functionality is exposed through
the `ClientBuilder::FromConfig()` static method, which accepts an array of configurations
and returns a fully built client.

Array keys correspond to the method name, e.g. `retries` key corresponds to `setRetries()` method.


[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'hosts' => [
        'localhost:9200'
    ],
    'retries' => 2,
    'handler' => ClientBuilder::singleHandler()
];
$client = ClientBuilder::fromConfig($params);
----


Unknown parameters will throw an exception, to help the user find potential problems.
If this behavior is not desired (e.g. you are using the hash for other purposes, and may have
keys unrelated to the Elasticsearch client), you can set $quiet = true in fromConfig() to
silence the exceptions.

[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'hosts' => [
        'localhost:9200'
    ],
    'retries' => 2,
    'imNotReal' => 5
];

// Set $quiet to true to ignore the unknown `imNotReal` key
$client = ClientBuilder::fromConfig($params, true);
----
