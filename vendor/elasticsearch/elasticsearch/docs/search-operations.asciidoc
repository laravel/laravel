== Search Operations

Well...it isn't called elasticsearch for nothing!  Let's talk about search operations in the client.

The client gives you full access to every query and parameter exposed by the REST API, following the naming scheme as
much as possible. Let's look at a few examples so you can become familiar with the syntax.

=== Match Query

Here is a standard curl for a Match query:

[source,shell]
----
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/my_index/my_type/_search' -d '{
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "testField" : "abc"
        }
    }
}'
----
{zwsp} +

And here is the same query constructed in the client:

[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'match' => [
                'testField' => 'abc'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];

$results = $client->search($params);
----
{zwsp} +

Notice how the structure and layout of the PHP array is identical to that of the JSON request body.  This makes it very
simple to convert JSON examples into PHP.  A quick method to check your PHP array (for more complex examples) is to
encode it back to JSON and check by eye:

[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'match' => [
                'testField' => 'abc'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];

print_r(json_encode($params['body']));


{"query":{"match":{"testField":"abc"}}}
----
{zwsp} +


.Using Raw JSON
****
Sometimes it is convenient to use raw JSON for testing purposes, or when migrating from a different system.  You can
use raw JSON as a string in the body, and the client will detect this automatically:

[source,php]
----
$json = '{
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "testField" : "abc"
        }
    }
}';

$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'body' => $json
];

$results = $client->search($params);
----
****
{zwsp} +

Search results follow the same format as Elasticsearch search response, the only difference is that the JSON response is
serialized back into PHP arrays. Working with the search results is as simple as iterating over the array values:

[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'match' => [
                'testField' => 'abc'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];

$results = $client->search($params);

$milliseconds = $results['took'];
$maxScore     = $results['hits']['max_score'];

$score = $results['hits']['hits'][0]['_score'];
$doc   = $results['hits']['hits'][0]['_source'];
----
{zwsp} +

=== Bool Queries

Bool queries can be easily constructed using the client. For example, this query:
[source,shell]
----
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/my_index/my_type/_search' -d '{
    "query" : {
        "bool" : {
            "must": [
                {
                    "match" : { "testField" : "abc" }
                },
                {
                    "match" : { "testField2" : "xyz" }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}'
----
{zwsp} +

Would be structured like this (Note the position of the square brackets):
[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'bool' => [
                'must' => [
                    [ 'match' => [ 'testField' => 'abc' ] ],
                    [ 'match' => [ 'testField2' => 'xyz' ] ],
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];

$results = $client->search($params);
----
{zwsp} +

Notice that the `must` clause accepts an array of arrays.  This will be serialized into an array of JSON objects internally,
so the final resulting output will be identical to the curl example.  For more details about arrays vs objects in PHP,
see link:_php_json_objects.html[Dealing with JSON Arrays and Objects in PHP].

=== A more complicated example

Let's construct a slightly more complicated example: a filtered query that contains both a filter and a query.
This is a very common activity in elasticsearch queries, so it will be a good demonstration.

The curl version of the query:

[source,shell]
----
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/my_index/my_type/_search' -d '{
    "query" : {
        "filtered" : {
            "filter" : {
                "term" : { "my_field" : "abc" }
            },
            "query" : {
                "match" : { "my_other_field" : "xyz" }
            }
        }
    }
}'
----
{zwsp} +

And in PHP:

[source,php]
----
$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'filtered' => [
                'filter' => [
                    'term' => [ 'my_field' => 'abc' ]
                ],
                'query' => [
                    'match' => [ 'my_other_field' => 'xyz' ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];


$results = $client->search($params);
----
{zwsp} +


=== Scan/Scroll

The Scan/Scroll functionality of Elasticsearch is similar to search, but different in many ways.  It works by executing a search query with a `search_type` of `scan`.  This initiates a "scan window" which will remain open for the duration of the scan.  This allows proper, consistent pagination.

Once a scan window is open, you may start _scrolling) over that window.  This returns results matching your query...but returns them in random order.  This random ordering is important to performance.  Deep pagination is expensive when you need to maintain a sorted, consistent order across shards.  By removing this obligation, Scan/Scroll can efficiently export all the data from your index.

This is an example which can be used as a template for more advanced operations:

[source,php]
----
$client = ClientBuilder::create()->build();
$params = [
    "search_type" => "scan",    // use search_type=scan
    "scroll" => "30s",          // how long between scroll requests. should be small!
    "size" => 50,               // how many results *per shard* you want back
    "index" => "my_index",
    "body" => [
        "query" => [
            "match_all" => []
        ]
    ]
];

$docs = $client->search($params);   // Execute the search
$scroll_id = $docs['_scroll_id'];   // The response will contain no results, just a _scroll_id

// Now we loop until the scroll "cursors" are exhausted
while (\true) {

    // Execute a Scroll request
    $response = $client->scroll([
            "scroll_id" => $scroll_id,  //...using our previously obtained _scroll_id
            "scroll" => "30s"           // and the same timeout window
        ]
    );

    // Check to see if we got any search hits from the scroll
    if (count($response['hits']['hits']) > 0) {
        // If yes, Do Work Here

        // Get new scroll_id
        // Must always refresh your _scroll_id!  It can change sometimes
        $scroll_id = $response['_scroll_id'];
    } else {
        // No results, scroll cursor is empty.  You've exported all the data
        break;
    }
}
