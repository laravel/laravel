Simple Test interface changes
=============================
Because the SimpleTest tool set is still evolving it is likely that tests
written with earlier versions will fail with the newest ones. The most
dramatic changes are in the alpha releases. Here is a list of possible
problems and their fixes...

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Classname::classname()
------------------------------------------------------------
SimpleTest renamed all of its constructors from 
Classname to __construct; derived classes invoking
their parent constructors should replace parent::Classname()
with parent::__construct().

Custom CSS in HtmlReporter not being applied
--------------------------------------------
Batch rename of protected and private methods 
means that _getCss() was renamed to getCss();
replace your function definition accordingly.

setReturnReference() throws errors in E_STRICT
----------------------------------------------
Happens when an object is passed by reference.
This also happens with setReturnReferenceAt().
If you want to return objects then replace these
with calls to returns() and returnsAt() with the
same arguments. This change was forced in the 1.1
version for E_STRICT compatibility.

assertReference() throws errors in E_STRICT
-------------------------------------------
Due to language restrictions you cannot compare
both variables and objects in E_STRICT mode. Use
assertSame() in this mode with objects. This change
was forced the 1.1 version.

Cannot create GroupTest
-----------------------
The GroupTest has been renamed TestSuite (see below).
It was removed completely in 1.1 in favour of this
name.

No method getRelativeUrls() or getAbsoluteUrls()
------------------------------------------------
These methods were always a bit weird anyway, and
the new parsing of the base tag makes them more so.
They have been replaced with getUrls() instead. If
you want the old functionality then simply chop
off the current domain from getUrl().

Method setWildcard() removed in mocks
-------------------------------------
Even setWildcard() has been removed in 1.0.1beta now.
If you want to test explicitely for a '*' string, then
simply pass in new IdenticalExpectation('*') instead.

No method _getTest() on mocks
-----------------------------
This has finally been removed. It was a pretty esoteric
flex point anyway. It was there to allow the mocks to
work with other test tools, but no one does this.

No method assertError(), assertNoErrors(), swallowErrors()
----------------------------------------------------------
These have been deprecated in 1.0.1beta in favour of
expectError() and expectException(). assertNoErrors() is
redundant if you use expectError() as failures are now reported
immediately.

No method TestCase::signal()
----------------------------
This has been deprecated in favour of triggering an error or
throwing an exception. Deprecated as of 1.0.1beta.

No method TestCase::sendMessage()
---------------------------------
This has been deprecated as of 1.0.1beta.

Failure to connect now emits failures
-------------------------------------
It used to be that you would have to use the
getTransferError() call on the web tester to see if
there was a socket level error in a fetch. This check
is now always carried out by the WebTestCase unless
the fetch is prefaced with WebTestCase::ignoreErrors().
The ignore directive only lasts for test case fetching
action such as get() and click().

No method SimpleTestOptions::ignore()
-------------------------------------
This is deprecated in version 1.0.1beta and has been moved
to SimpleTest::ignore() as that is more readable. In
addition, parent classes are also ignored automatically.
If you are using PHP5 you can skip this directive simply
by marking your test case as abstract.

No method assertCopy()
----------------------
This is deprecated in 1.0.1 in favour of assertClone().
The assertClone() method is slightly different in that
the objects must be identical, but without being a
reference. It is thus not a strict inversion of
assertReference().

Constructor wildcard override has no effect in mocks
----------------------------------------------------
As of 1.0.1beta this is now set with setWildcard() instead
of in the constructor.

No methods setStubBaseClass()/getStubBaseClass()
------------------------------------------------
As mocks are now used instead of stubs, these methods
stopped working and are now removed as of the 1.0.1beta
release. The mock objects may be freely used instead.

No method addPartialMockCode()
------------------------------
The ability to insert arbitrary partial mock code
has been removed. This was a low value feature
causing needless complications. It was removed
in the 1.0.1beta release.

No method setMockBaseClass()
----------------------------
The ability to change the mock base class has been
scheduled for removal and is deprecated since the
1.0.1beta version. This was a rarely used feature
except as a workaround for PHP5 limitations. As
these limitations are being resolved it's hoped
that the bundled mocks can be used directly.

No class Stub
-------------
Server stubs are deprecated from 1.0.1 as the mocks now
have exactly the same interface. Just use mock objects
instead.

No class SimpleTestOptions
--------------------------
This was replced by the shorter SimpleTest in 1.0.1beta1
and is since deprecated.

No file simple_test.php
-----------------------
This was renamed test_case.php in 1.0.1beta to more accurately
reflect it's purpose. This file should never be directly
included in test suites though, as it's part of the
underlying mechanics and has a tendency to be refactored.

No class WantedPatternExpectation
---------------------------------
This was deprecated in 1.0.1alpha in favour of the simpler
name PatternExpectation.

No class NoUnwantedPatternExpectation
-------------------------------------
This was deprecated in 1.0.1alpha in favour of the simpler
name NoPatternExpectation.

No method assertNoUnwantedPattern()
-----------------------------------
This has been renamed to assertNoPattern() in 1.0.1alpha and
the old form is deprecated.

No method assertWantedPattern()
-------------------------------
This has been renamed to assertPattern() in 1.0.1alpha and
the old form is deprecated.

No method assertExpectation()
-----------------------------
This was renamed as assert() in 1.0.1alpha and the old form
has been deprecated.

No class WildcardExpectation
----------------------------
This was a mostly internal class for the mock objects. It was
renamed AnythingExpectation to bring it closer to JMock and
NMock in version 1.0.1alpha.

Missing UnitTestCase::assertErrorPattern()
------------------------------------------
This method is deprecated for version 1.0.1 onwards.
This method has been subsumed by assertError() that can now
take an expectation. Simply pass a PatternExpectation
into assertError() to simulate the old behaviour.

No HTML when matching page elements
-----------------------------------
This behaviour has been switched to using plain text as if it
were seen by the user of the browser. This means that HTML tags
are suppressed, entities are converted and whitespace is
normalised. This should make it easier to match items in forms.
Also images are replaced with their "alt" text so that they
can be matched as well.

No method SimpleRunner::_getTestCase()
--------------------------------------
This was made public as getTestCase() in 1.0RC2.

No method restartSession()
--------------------------
This was renamed to restart() in the WebTestCase, SimpleBrowser
and the underlying SimpleUserAgent in 1.0RC2. Because it was
undocumented anyway, no attempt was made at backward
compatibility.

My custom test case ignored by tally()
--------------------------------------
The _assertTrue method has had it's signature changed due to a bug
in the PHP 5.0.1 release. You must now use getTest() from within
that method to get the test case. Mock compatibility with other
unit testers is now deprecated as of 1.0.1alpha as PEAR::PHPUnit2
should soon have mock support of it's own.

Broken code extending SimpleRunner
----------------------------------
This was replaced with SimpleScorer so that I could use the runner
name in another class. This happened in RC1 development and there
is no easy backward compatibility fix. The solution is simply to
extend SimpleScorer instead.

Missing method getBaseCookieValue()
-----------------------------------
This was renamed getCurrentCookieValue() in RC1.

Missing files from the SimpleTest suite
---------------------------------------
Versions of SimpleTest prior to Beta6 required a SIMPLE_TEST constant
to point at the SimpleTest folder location before any of the toolset
was loaded. This is no longer documented as it is now unnecessary
for later versions. If you are using an earlier version you may
need this constant. Consult the documentation that was bundled with
the release that you are using or upgrade to Beta6 or later.

No method SimpleBrowser::getCurrentUrl()
--------------------------------------
This is replaced with the more versatile showRequest() for
debugging. It only existed in this context for version Beta5.
Later versions will have SimpleBrowser::getHistory() for tracking
paths through pages. It is renamed as getUrl() since 1.0RC1.

No method Stub::setStubBaseClass()
----------------------------------
This method has finally been removed in 1.0RC1. Use
SimpleTestOptions::setStubBaseClass() instead.

No class CommandLineReporter
----------------------------
This was renamed to TextReporter in Beta3 and the deprecated version
was removed in 1.0RC1.

No method requireReturn()
-------------------------
This was deprecated in Beta3 and is now removed.

No method expectCookie()
------------------------
This method was abruptly removed in Beta4 so as to simplify the internals
until another mechanism can replace it. As a workaround it is necessary
to assert that the cookie has changed by setting it before the page
fetch and then assert the desired value.

No method clickSubmitByFormId()
-------------------------------
This method had an incorrect name as no button was involved. It was
renamed to submitByFormId() in Beta4 and the old version deprecated.
Now removed.

No method paintStart() or paintEnd()
------------------------------------
You should only get this error if you have subclassed the lower level
reporting and test runner machinery. These methods have been broken
down into events for test methods, events for test cases and events
for group tests. The new methods are...

paintStart() --> paintMethodStart(), paintCaseStart(), paintGroupStart()
paintEnd() --> paintMethodEnd(), paintCaseEnd(), paintGroupEnd()

This change was made in Beta3, ironically to make it easier to subclass
the inner machinery. Simply duplicating the code you had in the previous
methods should provide a temporary fix.

No class TestDisplay
--------------------
This has been folded into SimpleReporter in Beta3 and is now deprecated.
It was removed in RC1.

No method WebTestCase::fetch()
------------------------------
This was renamed get() in Alpha8. It is removed in Beta3.

No method submit()
------------------
This has been renamed clickSubmit() in Beta1. The old method was
removed in Beta2.

No method clearHistory()
------------------------
This method is deprecated in Beta2 and removed in RC1.

No method getCallCount()
------------------------
This method has been deprecated since Beta1 and has now been
removed. There are now more ways to set expectations on counts
and so this method should be unecessery. Removed in RC1.

Cannot find file *
------------------
The following public name changes have occoured...

simple_html_test.php --> reporter.php
simple_mock.php --> mock_objects.php
simple_unit.php --> unit_tester.php
simple_web.php --> web_tester.php

The old names were deprecated in Alpha8 and removed in Beta1.

No method attachObserver()
--------------------------
Prior to the Alpha8 release the old internal observer pattern was
gutted and replaced with a visitor. This is to trade flexibility of
test case expansion against the ease of writing user interfaces.

Code such as...

$test = &new MyTestCase();
$test->attachObserver(new TestHtmlDisplay());
$test->run();

...should be rewritten as...

$test = &new MyTestCase();
$test->run(new HtmlReporter());

If you previously attached multiple observers then the workaround
is to run the tests twice, once with each, until they can be combined.
For one observer the old method is simulated in Alpha 8, but is
removed in Beta1.

No class TestHtmlDisplay
------------------------
This class has been renamed to HtmlReporter in Alpha8. It is supported,
but deprecated in Beta1 and removed in Beta2. If you have subclassed
the display for your own design, then you will have to extend this
class (HtmlReporter) instead.

If you have accessed the event queue by overriding the notify() method
then I am afraid you are in big trouble :(. The reporter is now
carried around the test suite by the runner classes and the methods
called directly. In the unlikely event that this is a problem and
you don't want to upgrade the test tool then simplest is to write your
own runner class and invoke the tests with...

$test->accept(new MyRunner(new MyReporter()));

...rather than the run method. This should be easier to extend
anyway and gives much more control. Even this method is overhauled
in Beta3 where the runner class can be set within the test case. Really
the best thing to do is to upgrade to this version as whatever you were
trying to achieve before should now be very much easier.

Missing set options method
--------------------------
All test suite options are now in one class called SimpleTestOptions.
This means that options are set differently...

GroupTest::ignore() --> SimpleTestOptions::ignore()
Mock::setMockBaseClass() --> SimpleTestOptions::setMockBaseClass()

These changed in Alpha8 and the old versions are now removed in RC1.

No method setExpected*()
------------------------
The mock expectations changed their names in Alpha4 and the old names
ceased to be supported in Alpha8. The changes are...

setExpectedArguments() --> expectArguments()
setExpectedArgumentsSequence() --> expectArgumentsAt()
setExpectedCallCount() --> expectCallCount()
setMaximumCallCount() --> expectMaximumCallCount()

The parameters remained the same.
