            <p>
                If a bug is found in SimpleTest, chances are it'll get corrected
                inside the Subversion (SVN) tree with the corresponding test case : just to make
                sure the bug doesn't make a come back later on. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also the SimpleTest SVN trunk is usually full of little known
                experiments with code : new ideas are usually tried out there
                before a general release. Before it happens, the documentation needs
                to be completed : that's where this section comes into place. You'll
                find here new features the dev team is happy with : we're looking
                for comments...  
            </p>
            <p>
                The mailing-list is usually the best place to give feedback. Other options
                includes submitting a bug or a patch directly on the Sourceforge trackers...
            </p>
            <p class="experimental">
                Note : some of these features may never make it to a release or not for
                a long time!
