            <p>
                The <a local="simple_test">SimpleTest PHP unit tester</a> is in
                the 1.0.1 release cycle and is available for download from your nearest <a 
                href="http://souceforge.net/projects/simpletest/">SourceForge</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a PHP unit test, mock objects and web test framework.
                Users of <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> will be
                familiar with most of the interface.
                For web testing a small web browser is included, similar to
                <a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/">JWebUnit</a>.
                It has support for SSL, frames, proxies, basic authentication, redirects,
                and the standard HTML form controls.
                The idea is that common but fiddly PHP tasks, such as logging into a site,
                can be tested easily as calling <code>click()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is currently no support for JavaScript in the web tester.
                For testing these elements we recommend
                <a href="http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html">Selenium</a>.
