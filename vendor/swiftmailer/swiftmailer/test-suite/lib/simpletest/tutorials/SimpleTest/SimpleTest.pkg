<title>What is SimpleTest?</title>
            <para>
                The heart of SimpleTest is a testing framework built around
                test case classes.
                These are written as extensions of base test case classes,
                each extended with methods that actually contain test code.
                Top level test scripts then invoke the <span class="new_code">run()</span>
                methods on every one of these test cases in order.
                Each test method is written to invoke various assertions that
                the developer expects to be true such as
                <span class="new_code">assertEqual()</span>.
                If the expectation is correct, then a successful result is dispatched to the
                observing test reporter, but any failure triggers an alert
                and a description of the mismatch.
            </para>
            <para>
                A {@link test case.html test case} looks like this...
<programlisting role="php">
&lt;?php
class MyTestCase extends UnitTestCase {
    
    function testLog() {
        $log = &amp;new Log('my.log');
        $log-&gt;message('Hello');
        $this-&gt;assertTrue(file_exists('my.log'));
    }
}
?&gt;
</programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>
                These tools are designed for the developer.
                Tests are written in the PHP language itself more or less
                as the application itself is built.
                The advantage of using PHP itself as the testing language is that
                there are no new languages to learn, testing can start straight away,
                and the developer can test any part of the code.
                Basically, all parts that can be accessed by the application code can also be
                accessed by the test code if they are in the same language.
            </para>
            <para>
                The simplest type of test case is the
                {@link UnitTestCase.html UnitTestCase}.
                This class of test case includes standard tests for equality,
                references and pattern matching.
                All these test the typical expectations of what you would
                expect the result of a function or method to be.
                This is by far the most common type of test in the daily
                routine of development, making up about 95% of test cases.
            </para>
            <para>
                The top level task of a web application though is not to
                produce correct output from its methods and objects, but
                to generate web pages.
                The {@link WebTestCase.html WebTestCase} class tests web
                pages.
                It simulates a web browser requesting a page, complete with
                cookies, proxies, secure connections, authentication, forms, frames and most
                navigation elements.
                With this type of test case, the developer can assert that
                information is present in the page and that forms and
                sessions are handled correctly.
            </para>
            <para>
                A {@link WebTestCase.html WebTestCase} looks like this...
<programlisting role="php">
&lt;?php
class MySiteTest extends WebTestCase {
    
    function testHomePage() {
        $this-&gt;get('http://www.my-site.com/index.php');
        $this-&gt;assertTitle('My Home Page');
        $this-&gt;clickLink('Contact');
        $this-&gt;assertTitle('Contact me');
        $this-&gt;assertWantedPattern('/Email me at/');
    }
}
?&gt;
</programlisting>
            </para>

<title>Feature list</title>
            <para>
                The following is a very rough outline of past and future features
                and their expected point of release.
                I am afraid it is liable to change without warning as meeting the
                milestones rather depends on time available.
                Green stuff has been coded, but not necessarily released yet.
                If you have a pressing need for a green but unreleased feature
                then you should check-out the code from sourceforge CVS directly.
                A released feature is marked as "Done".

                PHP5 migraton will start straight after the version 1.1 series,
                whereupon PHP4 will no longer be supported.
                SimpleTest is currently compatible with PHP5, but will not
                make use of all of the new features until version 2.

                Process is at least as important as tools.
                The type of process that makes the heaviest use of a developer's
                testing tool is of course
                {@link http://www.extremeprogramming.org/ Extreme Programming}.
                This is one of the
                {@link http://www.agilealliance.com/articles/index Agile Methodologies}
                which combine various practices to "flatten the cost curve" of software development.
                More extreme still is {@link http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/ Test Driven Development},
                where you very strictly adhere to the rule of no coding until you have a test.
                If you're more of a planner or believe that experience trumps evolution,
                you may prefer the
                {@link http://www.therationaledge.com/content/dec_01/f_spiritOfTheRUP_pk.html RUP} approach.
                I haven't tried it, but even I can see that you will need test tools (see figure 9).

                Most unit testers clone {@link http://www.junit.org/ JUnit} to some degree,
                as far as the interface at least. There is a wealth of information on the
                JUnit site including the
                {@link http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm FAQ}
                which contains plenty of general advice on testing.
                Once you get bitten by the bug you will certainly appreciate the phrase
                {@link http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm test infected}
                coined by Eric Gamma.
                If you are still reviewing which unit tester to use the main choices
                are {@link http://phpunit.sourceforge.net/ PHPUnit}
                and {@link http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.phpunit.php Pear PHP::PHPUnit}.
                They currently lack a lot of features found in
                {@link http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php SimpleTest}, but the PEAR
                version at least has been upgraded for PHP5 and is recommended if you are porting
                existing {@link http://www.junit.org/ JUnit} test cases.

                Library writers don't seem to ship tests with their code very often
                which is a shame.
                Library code that includes tests can be more safely refactored and
                the test code can act as additional documentation in a fairly standard
                form.
                This can save trawling the source code for clues when problems occour,
                especially when upgrading such a library.
                Libraries using SimpleTest for their unit testing include
                {@link http://wact.sourceforge.net/ WACT} and
                {@link http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlsax PEAR::XML_HTMLSax}.

                There is currently a sad lack of material on mock objects, which is a shame
                as unit testing without them is a lot more work.
                The {@link http://www.sidewize.com/company/mockobjects.pdf original mock objects paper}
                is very Java focused, but still worth a read.
                As a new technology there are plenty of discussions and debate on how to use mocks,
                often on Wikis such as
                {@link http://xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/oldwiki.cgi?MockObjects Extreme Tuesday}
                or {@link http://www.mockobjects.com/wiki/MocksObjectsPaper www.mockobjects.com}
                or {@link http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MockObject the original C2 Wiki}.
                Injecting mocks into a class is the main area of debate for which this
                {@link http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mocktest.html paper on IBM}
                makes a good starting point.

                There are plenty of web testing tools, but most are written in Java and
                tutorials and advice are rather thin on the ground.
                The only hope is to look at the documentation for
                {@link http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/ HTTPUnit},
                {@link http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/ HTMLUnit}
                or {@link http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/ JWebUnit} and hope for clues.
                There are some XML driven test frameworks, but again most
                require Java to run.
                As SimpleTest does not support JavaScript you would probably
                have to look at these tools anyway if you have highly dynamic
                pages.
