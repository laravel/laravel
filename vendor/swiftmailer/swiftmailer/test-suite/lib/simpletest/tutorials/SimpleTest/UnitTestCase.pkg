<title>Unit test cases</title>
            <para>
                The core system is a regression testing framework built around
                test cases.
                A sample test case looks like this...
<programlisting role="php">
class FileTestCase extends UnitTestCase {
}
</programlisting>
                If no test name is supplied when chaining the constructor then
                the class name will be taken instead.
                This will be the name displayed in the test results.
            </para>
            <para>
                Actual tests are added as methods in the test case whose names
                by default start with the string "test" and
                when the test case is invoked all such methods are run in
                the order that PHP introspection finds them.
                As many test methods can be added as needed.
                For example...
<programlisting role="php">
require_once('../classes/writer.php');

class FileTestCase extends UnitTestCase {
    function FileTestCase() {
        $this-&gt;UnitTestCase('File test');
    }
    
    function setUp() {
        @unlink('../temp/test.txt');
    }
    
    function tearDown() {
        @unlink('../temp/test.txt');
    }
    
    function testCreation() {
        $writer = &amp;new FileWriter('../temp/test.txt');
        $writer-&gt;write('Hello');
        $this-&gt;assertTrue(file_exists('../temp/test.txt'), 'File created');
    }
}
</programlisting>
                The constructor is optional and usually omitted.
                Without a name, the class name is taken as the name of the test case.
            </para>
            <para>
                Our only test method at the moment is <span class="new_code">testCreation()</span>
                where we check that a file has been created by our
                <span class="new_code">Writer</span> object.
                We could have put the <span class="new_code">unlink()</span>
                code into this method as well, but by placing it in
                <span class="new_code">setUp()</span> and
                <span class="new_code">tearDown()</span> we can use it with
                other test methods that we add.
            </para>
            <para>
                The <span class="new_code">setUp()</span> method is run
                just before each and every test method.
                <span class="new_code">tearDown()</span> is run just after
                each and every test method.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can place some test case set up into the constructor to
                be run once for all the methods in the test case, but
                you risk test inteference that way.
                This way is slightly slower, but it is safer.
                Note that if you come from a JUnit background this will not
                be the behaviour you are used to.
                JUnit surprisingly reinstantiates the test case for each test
                method to prevent such interference.
                SimpleTest requires the end user to use <span class="new_code">setUp()</span>, but
                supplies additional hooks for library writers.
            </para>
            <para>
                The means of reporting test results (see below) are by a
                visiting display class
                that is notified by various <span class="new_code">assert...()</span>
                methods.
                Here is the full list for the <span class="new_code">UnitTestCase</span>
                class, the default for SimpleTest...

                All assertion methods can take an optional description to
                label the displayed result with.
                If omitted a default message is sent instead which is usually
                sufficient.
                This default message can still be embedded in your own message
                if you include "%s" within the string.
                All the assertions return true on a pass or false on failure.
            </para>
            <para>
                Some examples...
<programlisting role="php">
$variable = null;
$this-&gt;assertNull($variable, 'Should be cleared');
</programlisting>
                ...will pass and normally show no message.
                If you have
                {@link http://www.lastcraft.com/display_subclass_tutorial.php set up the tester to display passes}
                as well then the message will be displayed as is.
<programlisting role="php">
$this-&gt;assertIdentical(0, false, 'Zero is not false [%s]');
</programlisting>
                This will fail as it performs a type
                check as well as a comparison between the two values.
                The "%s" part is replaced by the default
                error message that would have been shown if we had not
                supplied our own.
                This also allows us to nest test messages.
<programlisting role="php">
$a = 1;
$b = $a;
$this-&gt;assertReference($a, $b);
</programlisting>
                Will fail as the variable <span class="new_code">$a</span> is a copy of <span class="new_code">$b</span>.
<programlisting role="php">
$this-&gt;assertWantedPattern('/hello/i', 'Hello world');
</programlisting>
                This will pass as using a case insensitive match the string
                <span class="new_code">hello</span> is contained in <span class="new_code">Hello world</span>.
<programlisting role="php">
trigger_error('Disaster');
trigger_error('Catastrophe');
$this-&gt;assertError();
$this-&gt;assertError('Catastrophe');
$this-&gt;assertNoErrors();
</programlisting>
                This one takes some explanation as in fact they all pass!
            </para>
            <para>
                PHP errors in SimpleTest are trapped and placed in a queue.
                Here the first error check catches the "Disaster"
                message without checking the text and passes.
                This removes the error from the queue.
                The next error check tests not only the existence of the error,
                but also the text which here matches so another pass.
                With the queue now empty the last test will pass as well.
                If any unchecked errors are left at the end of a test method then
                an exception will be reported in the test.
                Note that SimpleTest cannot catch compile time PHP errors.

            <para>
                The test cases also have some convenience methods for debugging
                code or extending the suite...
