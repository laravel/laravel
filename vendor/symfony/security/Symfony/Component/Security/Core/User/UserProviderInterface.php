 * Represents a class that loads UserInterface objects from some source for the authentication system.

 * In a typical authentication configuration, a username (i.e. some unique
 * user identifier) credential enters the system (via form login, or any
 * method). The user provider that is configured with that authentication
 * method is asked to load the UserInterface object for the given username
 * (via loadUserByUsername) so that the rest of the process can continue.
 *
 * Internally, a user provider can load users from any source (databases,
 * configuration, web service). This is totally independent of how the authentication
 * information is submitted or what the UserInterface object looks like.
